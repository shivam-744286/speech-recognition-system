note: need a stable internet connection as it uses google's recognition system

This project is made using following steps:

We import the speech_recognition library and give it a shortcut name sr for convenience.

This creates an instance of the Recognizer class which helps convert speech to text.

This opens the microphone and assigns it to a variable named source. The program will listen to the user's speech from this microphone.

It prompts the user to speak and listens to the audio input until a pause is detected.

The recognize_google() method sends the audio to Googleâ€™s servers and gets back the transcribed text, which is printed to the console.

If the speech is unclear or can't be understood, it shows an appropriate message.

If there's a problem connecting to the Google API (like no internet), it prints the error.
